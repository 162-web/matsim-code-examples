 <p>Examples in this tutorial are sorted by matsim extension points: mobsim, scenario, population, router, etc.
 Modes other than car, however, often need changes in more than one such extension point.  Examples that
 do not need extensions are collected here.  For multimodal examples that also need extensions check the links
